# VehicleRoutingProblem
A research on vehicle routing problem with its modeling, algorithms and optimization methods

The PDF file is a complete report that describes what we have researched and attempted in this project. The main topics we focus on is 
the class of delivery and pickup problems and the class of time window constraint problems. 

The two .ipynb files are the execution of the model respectively for the two problems in python. We take a great advantage of a python module 
called Google OR-Tools in the code. Google OR-Tool is built primarily for multiple classic optimization problems, including the vehicle routing problem. 
Readers can install the module by typing the following code:

python -m pip install --upgrade --user ortools, 

and they can follow the link https://developers.google.com/optimization for further exploration into the tool, if interested.

Hope you enjoy!
